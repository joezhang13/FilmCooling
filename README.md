# FilmCooling
Many modern gas turbine engines operate at high turbine inlet temperatures,
which at times may exceed the material limits of the turbine blades. 
To prevent failure, advanced cooling strategies are employed, including film cooling, in
which relatively cool air from upstream of the combustor is bled through channels inside the turbine blades, 
and out through holes in the blades. The cool air creates a protective film around the blades that protects
them from the hot air coming from the combustor. However, the injected air
may be problematic in cases when the upstream combustor runs fuel-rich sot
that fuel remains in the flow after combustion. This fuel can react with the
additional oxygen in the film cooling air, causing additional heat release.\

In this project, the interaction of air blowing from a film-cooling hole with
surrounding air and fuel will be simulated using a simplified geometry (a two-
dimensional at plate) and simplified physics (the Euler equations and a one-
equation reaction model). The computational domain is shown in the figure below.\
